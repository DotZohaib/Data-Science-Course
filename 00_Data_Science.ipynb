    "# What Do Data Scientists Do?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Data science is the study of large quantities of data, which can reveal insights that help organizations make strategic choices and drive informed decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Paths to Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many paths to a career in data science. While most involve **mathematics**, **programming**, and a natural **curiosity about data**, there is no single required trajectory. Different backgrounds—statistics, computer science, business, domain expertise—can all lead to a successful data science career.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Essential Traits of Data Scientists\n",
    "\n",
    "Successful data scientists share three critical attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Curiosity:** The drive to ask questions and explore data for hidden patterns and insights\n",
    "- **Judgment:** The ability to evaluate data quality, assess validity of findings, and make informed decisions about analysis approaches\n",
    "- **Argumentation:** The skill to defend findings, challenge assumptions, and communicate conclusions persuasively to stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Career Outlook and Compensation\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledgeable data scientists are in **high demand** in today's job market. The field offers:\n",
    "- **Competitive salaries** for skilled workers\n",
    "- Strong job growth and career advancement opportunities\n",
    "- Opportunities across diverse industries and sectors\n",

    "## The Data Scientist's Work\n",
    "\n",
    "### Varied Daily Activities\n",
    "The typical work day for a data scientist varies significantly depending on the type of project they are working on:\n",
    "- **Exploratory projects:** analyzing new datasets to discover patterns\n",
    "- **Predictive modeling:** building and optimizing algorithms\n",
    "- **Data pipeline development:** creating systems to process and manage data\n",
    "- **Stakeholder communication:** presenting findings and recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithms and Insights\n",
    "Many **algorithms** are used to extract insights from data. The choice of algorithm depends on:\n",
    "- The type of data available\n",
    "- The business question being asked\n",
    "- The desired outcome (classification, prediction, clustering, etc.)\n",
    "\n",

    "Essential data science concepts covered in this lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Term | Definition |\n",
    "|------|-----------|\n",
    "| **Outliers** | Data points that deviate significantly from the norm and may require special handling |\n",
    "| **Model** | A mathematical representation of relationships in data, used for prediction or classification |\n",
    "| **Algorithms** | Step-by-step procedures used to solve problems and extract patterns from data |\n",
    "| **JSON** | A lightweight data format for storing and exchanging structured data |\n",
    "| **XML** | A markup language for encoding data in a human-readable format |\n",
    "| **CSV** | Comma-separated values format for storing tabular data |\n",
    "| **Regression** | A statistical method for modeling relationships between variables |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
